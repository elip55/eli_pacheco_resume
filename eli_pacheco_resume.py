# HELLO WORLD!  Welcome to my resume in python!  

#  - VISION - 
# -----------------------
# MyVision1 =  to showcase coding skills while sending a resume simultaneously.
# MyVision2 =  to make the file simple enough to run without ANY elaborate python libraries.
# MyVision3 =  to write an (almost) universal output file; for the sake of convenience.
# MyVision4 =  to make a template simple enough for anyone with basic programming experience to edit and utilize
# NOTE: This program MUST be executed in python3.x which can be downloaded at: https://www.python.org
