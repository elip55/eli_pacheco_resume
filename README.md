# eli_pacheco_resume

This is the resume of Eli Pacheco, written in python. 

This program MUST be run in python3.X.

My vision is simple: I want the ability to showcase my coding skills while sending a resume simultaneously. 

I created a simple resume template, coded in python.

The engineering team can run this program and python will write a .txt resume locally. 

I will also work on a more complex version with classes and functions that an engineering team can clone and run locally.  The final product will be identical. 

There will also be a c++ program of this in the near future.
