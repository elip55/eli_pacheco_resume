# eli_pacheco_resume

This is the resume of Eli Pacheco, written in python. 

My vision is simple: I want the ability to showcase coding skills while sending a resume simultaneously. 
I created a simple resume template and coded the entire resume in python.

This program MUST be executed in python3.x.

# - INSTRUCTIONS -
-----------------------
Simply run this program locally.
Once the program is interpreted and executed, a .txt document will be written locally, as my resume.
#he .txt document will be saved in the same directory as the program.
