# eli_pacheco_resume

This is the resume of Eli Pacheco, written in python. 
This program MUST be run in python3.X.

My vision is simple: I want the ability to showcase coding skills while sending a resume simultaneously. 
I created a simple resume template and coded the entire resume in python.

The engineering team can run this program and it will save a .txt resume locally.
I will also work on a more complex program with classes and functions that an engineering team can clone and run locally.  The final product will be identical. 

There will also be a c++ program of this in the near future.
